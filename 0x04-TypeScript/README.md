# Typescript

This is a TypeScript project created as part of the tasks given by an unknown person.

## Task 0
In this task, we created a tsconfig.json file with some basic configurations for our TypeScript project.

## Task 1
In this task, we created a Person class with a constructor that takes two arguments, firstName and lastName. We also added a getFullName() method to the class that returns the full name of the person.

## Task 2
In this task, we created a Student class that extends the Person class. The Student class has two additional properties, id and subjects, and a method named getSubjects() that returns the list of subjects the student is enrolled in.

## Task 3
In this task, we created three classes Subject, Cpp, React, and Java. Cpp, React, and Java are subclasses of Subject. The Subject class has two properties, name and teacher. The Cpp, React, and Java classes have their own implementation of the getRequirements() and getAvailableTeacher() methods.

## Task 4
In this task, we created a new directory task_4 and copied the tsconfig.json and package.json files there. We also created the Teacher interface in a namespace named Subjects, and the Cpp, React, and Java classes in the same namespace. We also created and exported constants cpp, java, and react, and a cTeacher object with an experienceTeachingC value of 10. Lastly, we logged the results of calling the getRequirements() and getAvailableTeacher() methods of the Cpp, React, and Java classes with cTeacher as the teacher.

## Task 5
In this task, we created a new directory task_5 and copied the tsconfig.json, package.json, and webpack.config.js files there. We also created two interfaces, MajorCredits and MinorCredits, with a credits property and a brand property. Lastly, we created two functions, sumMajorCredits() and sumMinorCredits(), that take two arguments of type MajorCredits and MinorCredits, respectively, and return the sum of the credits of the two subjects.
